This extension has been tested in EE 1.6.0 (20070815). It works pretty well in earlier versions, too, though I haven't specifically tested it.

TO INSTALL:
===========
1. Copy the ext.publishimprove.php file to your extensions directory, and the lang.publishimprove.php file to the appropriate language directory.
2. Enable the extension via your admin panel (Admin -> Utilities -> Extension Manager).
3. Click on Settings and choose which modifications you want affecting your site.

TO UPGRADE:
===========
** If you don't disable the extension while upgrading, the extension probably won't work properly.**

1. DISABLE the extension via your admin panel (Admin -> Utilities -> Extension Manager). But first, if you don't remember what your settings are, look and refresh your memory. Write them down if you're really the forgetful type.
2. Copy the new ext.publishimprove.php file to your extensions directory, and the new lang.publishimprove.php file to the appropriate language directory.
3. Re-enable the extension via your admin panel (Admin -> Utilities -> Extension Manager).
4. Click on Settings to re-choose which modifications you want affecting your site.

TO UNINSTALL:
=============
1. Disable the extension via your admin panel (Admin -> Utilities -> Extension Manager). Your settings will be erased.
2. (optional) Remove the files from your server.


KNOWN ISSUES:
=============
* If you preview a new entry, the "Save As a Copy" checkbox goes away.  I don't consider this a huge problem.
* If you press the tab key while your cursor is in the very first characters of the template field, the field is blanked out.  Just UNDO to get it back, and don't press tab there.
* The Live Entry link is a best guess, and doesn't work at all with Pages -- I'm open for suggestions on how to make this work better, but it's a can of worms.


Copyright
=========
While all rights are reserved, I give an unlimited and irrevocable license to PMachine to use any or all (or none) of this code in Expression Engine to improve their product. I would love to see these options make their way into the core software.  I hope other developers consider doing the same with their license.

Thank you to Mark Huot, who showed me how to make my extension to play well with others.
Thank you to Rob Q and Arden, for their suggestions.
Thank you to G-B-O for his bug identification.
Thank you to Cap_Nemo who discovered that it wasn't working if you only had one blog (who only has one blog?!)
Thank you to Elwin Zuiderveld, whose modules provided inspiration for functionality in this one.  If you want a more locked-down solution for removing the Modules or My Account tab, I recommend his extension.

And thanks to the pMachine folks, without whom, etc. etc. etc.

Final note to those using this extension: I update it more often when I hear people are benefiting from it.  By all means, drop me a line and tell me what you'd like to see added.
