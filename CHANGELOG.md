## 1.7.0 - 2007-07-05
	
I have un-integrated the textarea resizer extension from this extension, upon request from that developer.
	
## 1.6.0 - 2007-06-26
	
- I have integrated the textarea extension into this extension. (See Copyright)
- Fixed a small publish page bug
- It now cleans out its own old extension hooks from 1.2. You don't have to disable it to upgrade it. Yeah!
	
## 1.5 - 2007-01-02
	
- Rewrote it to use fewer hooks, and a different method of showing/hiding buttons
- Added settings to allow folks to change the text on Preview/Quick Save/Save buttons, and next to the File Upload button
- I didn't make the File Upload box itself disappear for two reasons. 1) It would have looked unbalanced, and 2) it was too hard.
- Added link next to URL Title to preview the entry on the live site. This relies on the "search results" base URL for that entry's weblog
- built using EE 1.5.2 (20061128)
